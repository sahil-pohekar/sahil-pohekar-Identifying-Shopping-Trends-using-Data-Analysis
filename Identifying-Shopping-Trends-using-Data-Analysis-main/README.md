# Identifying Shopping Trends using Data Analysis

This project analyzes shopping trends based on a dataset of 3,900 customer transactions. It uncovers insights into customer behavior, demographic influences, and seasonal patterns to aid businesses in optimizing strategies.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Key questions on demographics, spending, and trends addressed using Python.
- **Visual Insights:** Clear visualizations for trends like purchase frequency, seasonal spending, and product preferences.
- **Actionable Insights:** Recommendations for marketing, inventory, and customer engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Location)
- Purchase details (Product Category, Amount, Frequency)
- Behavioral patterns (Promo Code Usage, Subscription Status, Shipping Preferences)

## Key Findings
1. Male customers dominate purchases (68%).
2. Fall season has the highest average spending.
3. Promo code users spend slightly less on average.
4. Popular items include Footwear and Jewelry.
